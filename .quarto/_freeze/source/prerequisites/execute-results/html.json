Notice, the workflow was so far tested with snakemake version 7.32.4.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nmamba create --name snakemake -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake=7.32.4 python=3.11.6\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Install NanoITS\n\nNanoITS can be installed via git:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit clone https://github.com/ndombrowski/NanoITS.git\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you do not have git installed, you can also download the folder from github. Therefore:\n\n1. Go to <https://github.com/ndombrowski/NanoITS>\n2. Click the green code button\n3. Download zip\n4. Extract zip",
