## Prerequisites

To run the workflow you need to have mamba (conda also works) and snakemake installed. 

All other software required by NanoITs will be installed by snakemake for you in a conda environment.


### Install conda

 Information about installing  mamba [here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html) and for conda can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/).

### Install snakemake

To install snakemake, check out the installation instructions found [here](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html). The workflow was so far tested with snakemake version 7.32.4.

### Install NanoITS

NanoITS can be installed via git:

```{bash}
git clone xx.git
```

If you do not have git installed, you can also download the folder from github. Therefore:

1. Go to xx
2. Click the green code button
