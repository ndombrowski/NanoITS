## Prerequisites

To run the workflow you need to have mamba (conda also works) and snakemake installed. 

All other software required by NanoITs will be installed by snakemake for you in a conda environment.


### Install conda

 Information about installing  mamba can be found [here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html) and for conda can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/).

### Install snakemake

After having installed conda/mamba you can install snakemake as follows. Notice, the workflow was so far tested with snakemake version 7.32.4.

```{bash}
mamba create --name snakemake -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake=7.32.4 python=3.11.6
```


### Install NanoITS

NanoITS can be installed via git:

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/ndombrowski/NanoITS.git
```

If you do not have git installed, you can also download the folder from github. Therefore:

1. Go to <https://github.com/ndombrowski/NanoITS>
2. Click the green code button
3. Download zip
4. Extract zip
